Transform this image into a mixed-media collage using the following steps:

1. Subject Isolation: Identify and isolate the main foreground subject. Preserve the subject's original photorealistic quality completely without any alteration to its texture or colors.
2. Cutout Effect: Apply a thick, rough white border around the entire edge of the isolated subject, making it look like a paper cutout or sticker.
3. Background Replacement: Replace the entire original background with a texture of beige, crumpled, old paper.
4. Scribble Overlays: Fill the new paper background with chaotic, hand-drawn doodles. These should include random stars, spirals, squiggles, arrows, and smiley faces rendered in vibrant primary colors (red, blue, yellow, green) resembling crayon or felt-tip marker art.
